Django Learning Project

This project serves as a practice environment while learning Django.
New features will be added progressively as I continue learning (new models, endpoints, ORM usage, views, migrations, and more).

Currently includes:

basic Django project structure

first model (Subject)

CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Django ORM and JSON response handling

The project will be continuously expanded with additional models and functionality.
